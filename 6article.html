  <h1 id="title3">BOTH WAYS</h1>

<p>A report compiled for the business community by Business Intelligence Program of the Stanford Research Institute has this to say: "Networks of reason computers (distributed processing) is not available to the general public at an earlier date is primarily a security present. entry or fraudulent access to a database management system can not be avoided. "
 </p>

 <p>This is a vital piece of information that the industry does not want you to know. There is this security problem. Large computer systems, shared in time are flexible Swiss cheese. Ask a programmer. Computer crime is a growing industry. Computer security is a myth. For each new data encryption system, there is a programmer out there somewhere that can break it. A program that sneaks it into an operating system is called a Trojan horse. In most computer centers, the Trojan Horse already inside the gates is.</p>

<p>Some worst gloomy scenarios could only be floating by corporate corridors these days.
Striking British officials recently shut down major government computer systems, and the result was chaos. Some of the information and assets probably will not be recoverable. Strikers simply puUed chips. Crude but effective. But what about the likelihood of more sophisticated guerrilla tactics such as computer know-how spreads throughout the population Quite a dilemma for the industry people :? They want you as a customer, but they can trust you? They need to sell computers and teach you the mechanics of programming, but they do not want to leave it too far to the distributed processing cycle. They need your business, but they are afraid of you. No joking. Over time, you could become too smart for their own good.
</p>

<p>Paranoia computer double-edged sword. The industry may be nervous about consumer participation widespread in future networks, but it seems much less concerned about privacy abuses of consumers in current systems. It is common knowledge - at least should be - the information that goes into such systems, information about you, your habits and activities, information from which your preferences can be deducted, is accessible to almost anyone. credit records, criminal records, medical records, driving records, financial data - the whole range. Now, more than is fair game.
</p>

<p>It is a mud case. Who decides who has access to what? No reason to be careful about controls and limitations on access to digital information, and equal reason to worry about what will happen if there are no such controls. The decision, in theory, will be a sociopoHtical question; the accessing actually be for those who know how. And what is being accessed will be almost everything.
