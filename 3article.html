<h1 id="title1">ROBOTICS</h1>
<h1 id="title2">AGE</h1>

<p id = "primeiro">Robots are creeping into the world so stealthily that most people still aren’t aware how many exist (thousands) or how intriguing they can be, particularly for the homebrew tinkerer with access to both a machine shop and a microcomputer. There’s a lot to tinker with — artificial intelligence, simulated senses, and the mechanical challenge of building an arm that will move only as far as you want it to and no further. By our stereotyped scifi standards robots are simple-minded but still potentially useful — both to large corporations and small workshops with repetitive or dangerous Jobs. (Auto companies are beginning to use $20,000 industrial robots to weld cars — they look like giant hairdryers, move with the jerky grace of the old “Lost in Space” robot, and work in a cloud of shooting sparks. Models made by independents are less threatening and more interesting.)
The books we’ve seen on robots and robotics are out-ofdate or fluff; but Robotics Age is current and solid. It’s for people who make their own. Even in its reports on heavy industry it pays attention to the low-budget applications of high budget ideas. To a casual observer, the possibilities and implications of this technology are, well, riveting.

<p>The MiniMover 5 tabletop arm is a unique instrument that attaches as a manipulative device to an inexpensive personal computer. It enables individuals or groups — such as schools and technical-interest clubs — to acquire “hands-on” experience with computer controlled automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics. The MiniMover 5 may be used for such applications as;</p>
<p>1) computer games, in which the arm moves game pieces on command;</p>
<p>2) computerized construction, in which building components may be arranged into a wide variety of configurations or mathematically programmed designs;</p>
<p>3) computer assembly, simulating automated factories of the future;</p>
<p>4) computer art, using graphic instruments such as paint brushes, felt tip pens, etc. directly.</p>

<p> Mr. Taft told Robotics Age that Milton Bradley is
currently spending over $600,000 per year for research on robot- and computer-related products. (This is roughly comparable to the entire NASA robotics research budget — ed.)
All this should be important news to Robotics Age readers. As the toy industry, already past masters at producing inexpensive mechanisms, discovers the vast potentials of robotics, we can expect to see an increasing array of cheap, practical devices suitable for computer interfacing, providing an attractive alternative to time-consuming hand-built items and expensive commercial equipment.
One final note — Mr. Taft tells us that Milton Bradley licenses the designs of about half of the devices it uses in its toys from outside sources, so you may want to send them that unique new sensor you’ve built!
