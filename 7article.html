<p>This book is a center of controversy amongst computerists, especially ttiose worldng in the field of artificial intelligence. It has received extensive praise and criticism, stimulated a heated and often bitter debate in the technical journals and generally raised a ruckus. It accomplished all this by raising serious moral and ethical questions regarding the use and social impact of computers. My own attitude about this work is mixed — I feel the topic is important but the treatment is lacking. However it is unquestionably significant, if only because of its effects on the information processing community. —Marc Le Brun
 </p>

 <p>This was one of the first books I ever read on the subject of computing. Though I agree that its argument isn’t completely convincing, I can’t think of a better introduction to the psycho-social issues in computer programming and artificial intelligence. —Art Kleiner </p>

<p> For my first experiment, I gave ELIZA a script designed to permit it to play (I should really say parody) the role of a Rogerian psychotherapist engaged in an initial interview with a patient. The Rogerian psychotherapist is relatively easy to imitate because much of his technique consists of drawing his patient out by reflecting the patient’s statements back to him. The following conversation between a young lady and ELIZA playing doctor illustrates both the Rogerian technique of encouraging a patient to keep talking and the operation of the computer program ELIZA. The first to “speak” is the young lady. The computer’s responses are printed entirely in capitals.

<p> Men are all alike.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">IN WHAT WAY</span></p>
<p>They’re always bugging us about something or the other.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE</span></p>
<p>Well, my boyfriend made me come here.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE</span></p>
<p>He says I’m depressed much of the time.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">I AM SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DePRESSED</span></p>
<p>It’s true. I am unhappy.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY</span></p>
<p>I need some help, that much seems certain.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT WOULD IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU GOT SOME HELP</span></p>
<p>Perhaps I could learn to get along with my mother.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY</span></p>
<p>My mother takes care of me.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU</span></p>
<p>My father.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">YOUR FATHER</span></p>
<p>You are like my father in some ways.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT RESEMBLANCE DO YOU SEE</span></p>
<p>You are not very aggressive but I think you don’t want me to notice that.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I AM NOT
VERY AGGRESSIVE</span></p>
<p>You don’t argue with me.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHY DO YOU THINK I DON’T ARGUE WITH YOU</span></p>
<p>You are afraid of me.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">DOES IT PLEASE YOU TO BELIEVE I AM AFRAID OF YOU</span></p>
<p>My father is afraid of everybody.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT ELSE COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR FATHER
Bullies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE . . .</span></p>

<p>The shocks I experienced as DOCTOR became widely known and “played” were due principally to three distinct events.
</p>
<p>1. A number of practicing psychiatrists seriously believed the DOCTOR computer program could grow into a nearly completely automatic form of psychotherapy .
</p>
<p>2. I was startled to see how quickly and how very deeply people conversing with DOCTOR became emotionally involved with the computer and how unequivocally they anthropomorphized it. Once my secretary, who had watched me work on the program for many months and therefore surely knew it to be merely a computer program, started conversing with it. . . .
</p>
<p>3. Another widespread, and to me surprising, reaction to the ELIZA program was the spread of a belief that it demonstrated a general solution to the problem of computer understanding or natural language. In my paper, I had tried to say that no general solution to that problem was possible, i.e., that language is understood only in contextual frameworks, that even these can be shared by people to only a limited extent, and that consequently even people are not embodiments of any such general solution.
