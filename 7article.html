<p>This book is a center of controversy between computerists, especially worldng ttiose in the field of artificial intelligence. He received extensive praise and criticism spurred a heated debate and often bitter in technical journals and generally raised a ruckus. He accomplished all this, raising serious moral and ethical questions about the use and social impact of computers. My own attitude about this work is mixed - I feel the issue is important, but the treatment is non-existent. However, it is undoubtedly significant, if only because of its effects on information processing community. -Marc Le Brun
 </p>

 <p>This was one of the first books I have ever read on the subject of computing. While I agree that your argument is not entirely convincing, I can not think of a better introduction to psycho-social issues in computer programming and artificial intelligence. -art Kleiner</p>

<p>For my first experience, I gave ELIZA a script designed to allow you to play (I should really say parody) the role of a psychotherapist Rogerian involved in an initial interview with a patient. The Rogerian psychotherapist is relatively easy to imitate, because much of his technique is to draw his patient by reflecting the patient's statements back to him. The following conversation between a young Eliza play doctor illustrates both Rogerian technique to encourage the patient to keep talking and operation of ELIZA computer program. The first "talking" is the girl. The computer answers are printed entirely in capital.

Men are all the same.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">IN WHAT WAY</span></p>
<p>They're always bugging us about something or other.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">CAN YOU THINK OF A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE</span></p>
<p>Well, my boyfriend made me come here.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">YOUR BOYFRIEND MADE YOU COME HERE</span></p>
<p>He says I'm depressed much of the time.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">SORRY TO HEAR YOU ARE DEPRESSED</span></p>
<p>It is true. I'm unhappy.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">DO YOU THINK COMING HERE WILL HELP YOU NOT TO BE UNHAPPY</span></p>
<p>I need some help, that much seems certain.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ANY HELP</span></p>
<p>Maybe I could learn to live with my mother.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">TALK MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY</span></p>
<p>My mom takes care of me</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY TAKES CARE OF YOU</span></p>
<p>My dad.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">YOUR FATHER</span></p>
<p>You are like my father in some ways.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT YOU SEE LIKENESS</span></p>
<p>You are not very aggressive but I think you do not want me to see it.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM NOT VERY AGGRESSIVE</span></p>
<p>You do not argue with me.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHY DO YOU THINK I DO NOT ARGUE WITH YOU</span></p>
<p>You are afraid of me.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">DO YOU PLEASE YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAVE FEAR OF YOU</span></p>
<p>My father is afraid of everybody.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: COURIER">WHAT ELSE COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR FATHER</span></p>
<p>Bullies.</p>

<p>The shock I experienced how the doctor became widely known and "played" was due mainly to three different events.
</p>
<p>1. A number of psychiatrists practicing seriously believed the doctor computer program could turn into an almost completely automatic form of psychotherapy.
</p>
<p>2. I was surprised to see how quickly and how deeply people who talk to the doctor became emotionally involved with the computer and how unequivocally that anthropomorphized it. Once my secretary, who had seen me work on the program for many months and therefore surely know that it is just a computer program, started talking to him. . . .
</p>
<p>3. Another widespread, and surprise me, the reaction to the ELIZA program was the spread of a belief that he has shown a general solution to the problem of understanding natural language or computer. In my article, I had tried to say that no general solution to the problem was possible, ie, that language is understood only in contextual frameworks, that even these can be shared by people only to a limited extent, and that consequently even people are not embodiments of any such general solution.
