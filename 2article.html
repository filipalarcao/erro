<p>Basically what’s going on beneath this zealous name is that computers are now in the public library in Menio Park, California. People can use them free of charge, and there is lots of effort made to make training available at a low cost (or free). Frequently kids teach other kids and learn in the teaching. Adults can use the machines too, try things out before investing in their own computers. You can do the same in your town. This fledgling newsletter will encourage and help. It’s associated with the People’s Computer Company (of Dr. Dobb’s Journal and Recreational Computing) and put together by Bob Albrecht and Ramon Zamora, the Pied Pipers of computer accessibility. —Art Kleiner

 <p>Begin by doing it! Just start. Don’t wait for the right time, or the right place, or enough people, or the grant that you could get. Just start by starting.</p>
<p>If you have a small computer, and if you have a few friends that have small computers, go to the public library (or local bookstore, or pizza place, or . . . anyplace will do) and tell them you want to hold about a three hour meeting once a month. Give them a copy of this bulletin to read. If all else fails, set it up in your home for the first few months.
</p>
<p>When you have a goodly number of people attending, ask your local computer store people to drop by and bring computers and software for demonstrations. If they have any old or used equipment, ask them to donate it to the project. The same goes for the user groups. They often have old machines that they can donate to such a project. </p>
