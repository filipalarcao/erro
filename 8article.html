<p>These images from space are riot what the human eye can see. They are made with film specially sensitive to waves of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared, that are in visible to us limited mammalian critters. For instance, computer enhanced false infrared (my favorite image) pops out healthy vegetation in bright red, makes clear water a glistening black, and asphalt or roof-tops are a soft blue to blue-gray.
Landsat satellite images (or “photomaps”) of your home town are made every 18 days as this persevering satellite sticks tenaciously to its orbit. So, you can get (if the clouds are right) a complete calendar of your home or perhaps a photo of your birthplace on the day you were born.
 </p>
<h4>ACCESS
</h4>
<p>As usual here on Earth, government-anything means lots of paperwork. Don’t despair. It’s absolutely interesting and worthwhile to view your home (or anywhere) from out there (and at many seasons and years). Just follow the procedures as if your taxes depended on it. </p>
<h4>THE FOOL-PROOF METHOD
</h4>
<p> You get what you want, but it requires weeks to even months of patience. Simply write to:
Users Service Unit
EROS Data Center
Sioux Falls, SD 57198 or call
(605) 594-6511
Ask for “Geosearch Inquiry Form” and instructions. You fill it out fur latitude/longitude, name or location of point of interest (the smaller the area, the quicker the results). They send you a computer printout (and cryptic decoder) of everything available in aerial photography. You choose the images and fill out an order form. Since you never see the images before buying them, this method is somewhat of a gamble.
</p>
<h4>THE SHORTCUT METHOD
</h4>
<p> Go directly to browse files set up for citizens. Go through the catalogs of available photos (a bunch of dates and codes) and, in many cases, look through the microfilm of actual photos. The person-in-charge will show you how to code your request to match the satellite path over your home and can give you the order forms. In the lingo, this is the “Quick Response System.”
</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT SHORTER METHOD IF YOU KNOW EXACTL Y WHA T YOU WANT If you don’t live near a browse file, you might do this. Request: “Single ERTS Coverage” for one point on Earth.
Single ERTS photomaps do not include Skylab, NASA aircraft,and low altitude flights. It’s just Landsat satellites in b-and-w and false color. They send you a “Coverage Map” and you return a form which pinpoints the orbital path. —Peter Warshall

<p>Prices for satellite photographs range from $8 to $50, depending on the size of the picture, whether it is blackand- white, color or color-infrared, and whether it is on filnfi or paper. Prices for aircraft photographs range from $3 to $50, depending on the same criteria. There are approximately 30 browse files in state capitals and other cities around the country, and the list is continually being expanded.</p>
