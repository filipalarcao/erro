<p>These space images are riot that the human eye can see. They are made with film especially sensitive to waves of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared, which are visible to us animals limited mammals. For example, false increased computer (my favorite picture) Infrared skirt healthy vegetation in bright red, makes the clear water a glossy black, and asphalt roofs or are a soft blue to blue-gray.
Landsat satellite images (or "photomaps") from his hometown are made every 18 days, as this persevering satellite tenaciously adheres to its orbit. So you can get (if the clouds are on the right) a complete calendar of your home or perhaps a photo of your place of birth, on the day he was born.
 </p>
<h4>ACCESS
</h4>
<p>As usual here on earth, the government, anything mean lots of paperwork. Do not freak out. It is quite interesting and worth to see your home (or anywhere) from outside (and in many seasons and years). Just follow the procedures as if their taxes depended on it.</p>
<h4>METHOD UNFAILING
</h4>
<p> You get what you want, but it requires weeks to even months of patience. Just write to:
   Unit service users
   EROS Data Center
   Sioux Falls, SD 57198 or call
   (605) 594-6511
   Ask "Inquiry Form Geosearch" and instructions. You fill it skin latitude / longitude, name or location of point of interest (the lower area, the faster the results). They send you a computer printout (and cryptic decoder) of all that is available in aerial photography. You choose the images and fill out an application form. Since you never see the images before you buy them, this method is a bit of a gamble.
</p>
<h4>THE SHORTCUT METHOD
</h4>
<p> Go directly to search files created for citizens. Go through the pictures from catalogs available (a lot of dates and codes) and, in many cases, look through the actual photos microfilm. The person-in-charge will show you how to code your application to match the satellite path on your home and can give you the order forms. In the jargon, this is the "System of Rapid Response."
</p>
<h4>METHOD A LITTLE SHORT IF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT</h4>
<p>If you do not live near a search file, you can do this. Request: "Single Cover ERTS" to a point on Earth.
individual photomaps ERTS not include Skylab, NASA aircraft and low altitude flights. It's just Landsat satellites in b-and-w and false color. They send you a "Coverage Map" and you return a form that points the orbital path. -Peter Warshall
</p>

<p>Prices for satellite photographs range from $ 8 to $ 50, depending on the size of the image, if blackand- white, color or color-infrared, and is in filnfi or paper. Prices for photographs aircraft range from $ 3 to $ 50, depending on the same criteria. There are approximately 30 index files in capital and other cities across the country, and the list is continuously being expanded.</p>
