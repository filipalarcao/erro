<p>A wise book about how civilization will adapt to computing and vice versa. The authors are among the first to notice in print that the styles and practices of programming are already influencing the rest of the culture. The book looks forward to a shared intelligence between humans and computers, on the order of (but more interwovenly complex than) this dialog: Computer: “A and B have 4 similarities and 1,317 dissimilarities.” Person: “Yes, but the differences aren’t important.” Peter Huyck and Nellie Kremenak are programmers who write English wittily and literately even by New Yorker standards. There’s a gem of insight into the humanmachine relationship on practically every page of their book. —Art Kleiner

<h3> Exercise for students </h3>
<p>We have some code which allows the banks to know more about us, but where is the code which allows us to know more about the banks? Write this code. Lewis Mumford described the clock as the “key-machine” of the modern industrial age and considered its invention more significant than that of the steam engine.
“The clock, moreover, is a piece of power-machinery whose ‘product’ is seconds and minutes: by its essential nature it dissociated time from human events and helped create the belief in an independent world of mathematically measurable sequences: the special world of science.”

<p> In the case of human/television interaction, the human is the more adaptive partner, and so there is a tendency for the human to adapt to the TV (watch whatever is on) rather than for the TV to adapt to the human (programming changes), which involves a long and complex feedback loop. The same problem arises in a human/programin- computing-machine partnership. The human can adapt quickly, but the feedback for the machine to adapt (particularly if the human is not a programmer) is long
and complex.
</p>

<p> What is on television is due largely to accidents of history and the subsequent skewing of evolution by considerations of the marketplace. Current human/machine systems are also early accidents, and the systems of the future will evolve from them. We should tamper with existing systems in the direction of incorporating more sophisticated assumptions than are found in the average bit of FORTRAN so that the systems of the future will have evolved from happier accidents. As a minimum step toward this goal, the feedback loop for machine adaptation must be shortened so that machines will be at least as adaptable as humans — a tall order. Otherwise, the machines will win out as we adapt to them. It will not be an exotic win of the sci-fi type, but a win of drudgery, inconsequence, boredom, and stacks of output.
